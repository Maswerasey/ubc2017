This folder contains code to examine the N_body simulation data used in:
"An intermediate-mass black hole in the centre of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae" Nature paper.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02149


model_code.py produces v(r) plots and uses the maximum likelihood function
fitting to regain the black hole mass. 

Note: resulting Mass ratio is very different from the one given in the paper.
