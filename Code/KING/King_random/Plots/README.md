#Plots

this folder contains the resulting plos from the resampling code. 

datafiles are named as follows: 
variable_model_fit.png 

for example hist_a_BH(_00).png is the histogram for the a variable when using black hole random clusters and fitting a no black hole model. 

most interesting plots are 

![mbh_00] (hist_MB_00_BH.png)
showing the resulting black hole mass when fitting no black hole systems and

![lnL_bh] (hist_lnL_BH_BH.png) 
showing the likelihood distribution for the black hole fitting.
